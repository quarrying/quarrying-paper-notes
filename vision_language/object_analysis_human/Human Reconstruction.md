## SMPL, Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model
----
> SMPL is a realistic 3D model of the human body that is based on skinning and blend shapes and is learned from thousands of 3D body scans. This site provides resources to learn about SMPL, including example FBX files with animated SMPL models, and code for using SMPL in Python, Maya and Unity.

## SMPL-X, SMPL eXpressive
----
> SMPL-X combines the developments from SMPL, MANO and FLAME models to create a unified model, called SMPL-X, for SMPL eXpressive, with shape parameters trained jointly for the face, hands and body.
