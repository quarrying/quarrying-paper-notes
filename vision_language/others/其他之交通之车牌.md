## CLPD, Chinese License Plate Recognition
---
> The CLPD dataset comprises 1200 images that encompass various regions within mainland China. These images were sourced from diverse origins, including the internet, mobile devices, and in-car recording devices. While the majority of the images were recorded during daylight hours, a portion of them were captured at nighttime. The dataset predominantly features passenger cars, with a limited number of images depicting trucks and buses.

## AOLP, Application-oriented License Plate
---
> The application-oriented license plate (AOLP) benchmark database has 2049 images of Taiwan license plates. This database is categorized into three subsets: access control (AC) with 681 samples, traffic law enforcement (LE) with 757 samples, and road patrol (RP) with 611 samples.
