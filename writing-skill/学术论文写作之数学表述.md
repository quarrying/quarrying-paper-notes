    range from 0 to n exclusive

    range from 0 to n inclusive

    All values are between 0 and 1 inclusive

    where N(0; 1) denotes the standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance

    In the algorithm, epsilon is a constant added to the mini-batch variance for numerical stability.

    x is formulated as Eq. 1
