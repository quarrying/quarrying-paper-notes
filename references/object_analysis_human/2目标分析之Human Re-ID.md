## Market-1501, Market-1501+500k 
Market-1501, 顾名思义有 1501 个类.

Market-1501 dataset contains 32,668 labeled bounding boxes of 1,501 identities.

Six cameras are used: five high-resolution cameras and one low-resolution camera. 

The dataset is split into two parts: 12,936 images with 751 identities for training and 19,732 images with 750 identities for testing. 

There are 3,368 query images and 19,732 gallery images with 2,793 distractors.

## DukeMTMC-ReID
DukeMTMC-ReID is a subset of DukeMTMC for person ReID. The images are cropped by hand-drawn bounding boxes.

DukeMTMC-ReID contains 36,411 images of 1,812 identities shot by 8 high-resolution cameras. 

It contains 16,522 training images of 702 identities, 2,228 query images of the other 702 identities and 17,661 gallery images.

## CUHK01
This is a larger dataset for the person
re-id task, which contains 971 persons captured from
two camera views in a campus environment. Camera
view A captures frontal or back views of a person
while camera B captures the person’s profile views.
Each person has four images with two from each camera.

## CUHK03
CUHK03 consists of 13164 images from 1360 identities. 
It provides two settings, one is annotated by human (labeled) 
and the other one is annotated by detectors (detected).

## VIPeR
This dataset contains two views of 632 persons.
Each pair for a person is captured by different
cameras with different viewpoints, poses, and lighting
conditions. It is one of the most challenging datasets
for the person re-id task due to its huge variance and
discrepancy.

## PRID2011
PRID2011 contains frames in two views captured at different positions of a street. 
CameraA has 385 identities while CameraB has 749 identities, and the two videos have a overlap of 200 people. 
Each person has 5 to 675 images, and the average number is 100.

## i-LIDS
It is constructed from video images shooting
a busy airport arrival hall. It contains 479 images
from 119 persons, which are normalized to 128 × 64
pixels. Each person has four images in average. These
images are captured by non-overlapping cameras, and
are subject to large illumination changes and occlusions.
