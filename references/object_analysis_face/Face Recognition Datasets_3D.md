## FRGCv2
---
FRGCv2 by far still remains the largest 3D face recognition benchmark dataset with 446 identities.

## ND-2006
---
ND-2006 (a superset of FRGCv2) has only 13,540 scans of 888 unique identities and took over two years to collect.

## GavabDB
---
The GavabDB database contains 427 scans, with seven scans per ID, three
neutral and four expressions. The expressions in this dataset
vary considerably, including sticking out the tongue and
strong facial distortions. Additionally it has strong artifacts
due to facial hair, motion and the bad scanner quality. This
dataset is typical for a non-cooperative environment.

The UND database was used in the face recognition grand challenge and consists of 953 scans, with one to eight scans
per ID. It is of better quality and contains only slight expression variations. It represents a cooperative scenari
