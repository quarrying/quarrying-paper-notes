## IJB-A Dataset
IJB-A IARPA Janus Benchmark-A (IJB-A) contains 500 subjects with a total of 25, 813 images (5, 399 still images and 20, 414 video frames). 

The IJB-A dataset was released in 2015 in an attempt to push the frontiers of unconstrained face recognition. Given that recognition performance on the LFW dataset has saturated under the standard protocol, the IJB-A dataset contains more challenging face images and specifies both verification and identification (open and close sets) protocols.

Some key features of the IJB-A dataset include: full pose variation, a mix of images and videos, and a wider demographic variation of subjects than is available in the LFW dataset. The dataset was developed using 1,501,267 crowd sourced annotations.

### JANUS Challenge Set 2 (JANUS CS2)
The IJB-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces of 500 subjects with significant pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and Youtube Face (YTF) datasets. JANUS CS2 is the extended version of IJB-A which contains not only all the images/frames of IJB-A but also includes the original videos for evaluating the video-based face verification system. 
The dataset includes 25,800 images of 500 subjects.

### Janus Challenge Set 3 (Janus CS3)
the extended version of IJB-A, Janus Challenge Set 3 (Janus CS3), which is a superset of IJB-A and is much more challenging. Janus CS3 contains 1,871 subjects with 11,876 still images and 55,372 video frames sampled from 7,094 videos.

## IJB-B
IARPA Janus Benchmark-B (IJB-B) dataset consists of 1,845 subjects with a total of 76,824 images (21,798 still images and 55,026 video frames from 7,011 videos), an average of 41 images per subject. Images in this dataset are labeled with ground truth bounding boxes and other covariate meta-data such as occlusions, facial hair and skin tone.
