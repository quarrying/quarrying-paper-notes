## MORPH (Craniofacial Longitudinal Morphological Face Database)
The Morph dataset contains 55.1k frontal face images
of more than 13.6k individuals. For each image, it provides
information about the person’s gender, ethnicity, age, beard,
and glasses. 80.4% of the faces belong to the ethnicity black,
19.2% to white, and 0.4% to others. The individual’s age vary
from 16-77 years. 79.4% of the faces are within an age-range
of [20, 50]. In total, the Morph database provides over 0.5M
labels for soft-biometric attributes.

## PCSO, Pinellas County Sheriffs Office
A large collection of mugshot images (not in the public domain) acquired from the Pinellas County Sheriffs Office (PCSO), comprising of 1,447,607 images of 403,619 subjects.


## FFHQ, Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset
Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ) is a dataset consist of human faces and includes more variation than CELEBA-HQ dataset in terms of age, ethnicity and image background, and also has much better coverage of accessories such as eyeglasses, sunglasses, hats, etc. The images were crawled from Flickr and then automatically aligned and cropped.  

Size: The dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality PNG images at 1024×1024 resolution and contains considerable variation in terms of age, ethnicity and image background. 

This dataset was originally created as a benchmark for generative adversarial networks (GAN).

## Real and Fake Face Detection
This dataset contains expert-generated high-quality photoshopped face images where the images are composite of different faces, separated by eyes, nose, mouth, or whole face.

Size: The size of the dataset is 215MB 

Projects: This dataset can be used to discriminate real and fake images.
