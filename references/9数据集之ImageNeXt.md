# JFT-300M
JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and 303M million high-resolution images.

JFT-300M dataset, which contains 300M noisily labelled images.

JFT-300M consists of around 300 million images with 1.26 labels per image on average. The labels are organized into a hierarchy of 18291 classes. Annotation is performed using an automatic pipeline, and are therefore imperfect; approximately 20% of the labels are noisy.

# Open Images

## Open Images V5
Open Images is a dataset of ~9M images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, and visual relationships. It contains a total of 16M bounding boxes for 600 object classes on 1.9M images, making it the largest existing dataset with object location annotations. The boxes have been largely manually drawn by professional annotators to ensure accuracy and consistency. The images are very diverse and often contain complex scenes with several objects (8.3 per image on average). Open Images also offers visual relationship annotations, indicating pairs of objects in particular relations (e.g. "woman playing guitar", "beer on table"). In total it has 329 relationship triplets with 391,073 samples. In V5 we added segmentation masks for 2.8M object instances in 350 classes. Segmentation masks mark the outline of objects, which characterizes their spatial extent to a much higher level of detail. Finally, the dataset is annotated with 36.5M image-level labels spanning 19,969 classes.

## Open Images V4
Open Images is a dataset of ~9M images that have been annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes and visual relationships. The training set of V4 contains 14.6M bounding boxes for 600 object classes on 1.74M images, making it the largest existing dataset with object location annotations. The boxes have been largely manually drawn by professional annotators to ensure accuracy and consistency. The images are very diverse and often contain complex scenes with several objects (8.4 per image on average). This also encorages structural image annotations, such as visual relationships. Moreover, the dataset is annotated with image-level labels spanning thousands of classes.
