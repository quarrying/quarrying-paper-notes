CIFAR (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) 是由 Hinton 的两个大弟子 Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever 收集的一个用于普适物体识别的数据集. 图像尺寸为 32x32.

> Both of the CIFAR datasets consist of 60,000 colour images of size 32 × 32 pixels. CIFAR-10 has 10 distinct classes, such as cat, dog, car, and boat. CIFAR-100 contains 100 classes, but requires much more fine-grained recognition compared to CIFAR-10 as some classes are very visually similar. For example, it contains five different classes of trees: maple, oak, palm, pine, and willow. Each dataset is split into a training set with 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images.

> The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

> The CIFAR-100 dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).
