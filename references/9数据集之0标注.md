## LabelBee
---
商汤开源的一款标注工具, 比较强大.

## LabelImg
---
LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool and label object bounding boxes in images.

Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet. Besides, it also supports YOLO and CreateML formats.

常用快捷键:
- Create RectBox: W 
- Next Image: D
- Previous Image: A
  
**labelimg 的缺点**
1) 不能标 source
2) 标注文件名不包含图像名后缀, 这样容易导致同基本名不同后缀名的图像文件对应同一个标注文件. 不过这一情况可以通过为图像文件设置来避免.

## PixelAnnotationTool
---
Software that allows you to manually and quickly annotate images in directories. The method is pseudo manual because it uses the algorithm watershed marked of OpenCV. The general idea is to manually provide the marker with brushes and then to launch the algorithm. If at first pass the segmentation needs to be corrected, the user can refine the markers by drawing new ones on the erroneous areas (as shown on video below).
