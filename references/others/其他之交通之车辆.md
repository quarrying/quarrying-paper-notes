## VehicleID
---
This dataset comprises 221,763 bounding boxes of 26,267 identities, captured across various surveillance cameras in a city. Annotations include 250 vehicle models and this dataset has an order of magnitude more images than VeRi dataset. However the viewpoints only include front and rear views for vehicles.

## UA-DETRAC
----
UA-DETRAC is a challenging real-world multi-object detection and multi-object tracking benchmark.The dataset consists of 10 hours of videos captured with a Cannon EOS 550D camera at 24 different locations at Beijing and Tianjin in China. The videos are recorded at 25 frames per seconds (fps), with resolution of 960×540 pixels.There are more than 140 thousand frames in the UA-DETRAC dataset and 8250 vehicles that are manually annotated, leading to a total of 1.21 million labeled bounding boxes of objects.We also perform benchmark tests of state-of-the-art methods in object detection and multi-object tracking, together with evaluation metrics detailed in this website.

## VeRi-776
---
VeRi-776 dataset is collected with 20 cameras in real-world traffic
surveillance environment. A total of 776 vehicles are annotated. 200 vehicles are
used for testing. The remaining 576 vehicles are for training. There are 11,579
images in the test set, and 37,778 images in the training set.

## PKU-VD
---
This dataset is split into two sub-datasets, namely VD1 and VD2 based on cities from which they were captured. The images in VD1 are captured from high resolution cameras, while images for VD2 are obtained from surveillance cameras. There are about 71k and 36k identities in VD1 and VD2, respectively.
