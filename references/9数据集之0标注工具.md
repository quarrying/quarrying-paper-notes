## PixelAnnotationTool
Software that allows you to manually and quickly annotate images in directories. The method is pseudo manual because it uses the algorithm watershed marked of OpenCV. The general idea is to manually provide the marker with brushes and then to launch the algorithm. If at first pass the segmentation needs to be corrected, the user can refine the markers by drawing new ones on the erroneous areas (as shown on video below).
