# *Semi-Supervised*

**OPINIONS**: 
- 主动学习和半监督学习感觉是一体两面, 前者是 (由专家) 给困难样本打标签, 后者是 (由算法) 给简单样本打伪标签

## FixMatch
---
> FixMatch firstly applies the weak and strong augmentations to the same input image, respectively, to generate two versions, then uses the weakly-augmented version to generate hard pseudo labels. The model is trained on strongly-augmented versions to align predictions with pseudo labels.
