## [2022] Towards Online Domain Adaptive Object Detection
---
本文提出了一种 Online Source-Free Domain Adaptation (Online-SFDA) 的方法.

文中提到的域适应的概念:
- UDA (Unsupervised Domain Adaptation): assume that both labelled source data and unlabeled target data are available during adaptation.
- SFDA (Source-Free Domain Adaptation): a source-trained model is adapted towards the target domain without requiring access to the source data.
- Online-SFDA: where a model is adapted to any distribution shifts encountered during deployment in an online manner.
- test-time adaptation: adaptation is performed during test-time.

UDA 的方法可以分为 3 类: adversarial training, self-training and image-to-image translation.
