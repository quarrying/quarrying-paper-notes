## Fishnet
----
The v0.2.0 dataset contains 406,463 bounding boxes for 34 object classes (composed entirely of fish species and humans) on 86,029 images with an average of 5 bounding boxes per image. We've also included a higher order label that groups fishes that lack a sufficient number of examples (< 100).
