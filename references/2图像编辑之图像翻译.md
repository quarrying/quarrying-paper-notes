> A layer with $N_l$ distinct filters has $N_l$ feature maps each of size $M_l$, where $M_l$ is the height times the width of the feature map. So the responses in a layer $l$ can be stored in a matrix $F_l \in \mathcal{R}^{N_l} \times \mathcal{R}^{M_l}$. 
> These feature correlations are given by the Gram matrix $G_l \in \mathcal{R}^{N_l} \times \mathcal{R}^{N_l}$.

Gram 矩阵表示的是同一层 feature map 的不同通道之间的关系.
