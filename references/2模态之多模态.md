## Conceptual 12M, CC12M
---
> CC12M is on purpose designed for vision-and-language pre-training, and meant to be disjoint from CC3M. CC3M is cleaner and more appropriate for fine-tuning, but can be used in conjunction with CC12M for pre-training, as illustrated in our paper. Coincidentally, their intersection is found to be non-zero — approximately 63K URLs.
