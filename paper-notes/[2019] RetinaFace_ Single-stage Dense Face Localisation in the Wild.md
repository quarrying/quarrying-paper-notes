> A narrow definition of face localisation may refer to traditional face detection [53, 62], which aims at estimating the face bounding boxes without any scale and position prior. Nevertheless, in this paper we refer to a broader definition of face localisation which includes face detection [39], face alignment [13], pixelwise face parsing [48] and 3D dense correspondence regression [2, 12]. That kind of dense face localisation provides accurate facial position information for all different scales.

> Different from generic object detection, face detection features smaller ratio variations (from 1:1 to 1:1.5) but much larger scale variations (from several pixels to thousand pixels).
